### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Dean**, a Principal Software Engineer with over 13 years of experience specializing in **Angular**. Currently, Iâ€™m working at **CGI Group**, where Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to contribute to large-scale modernization projects, including the highly complex **DARTS project** for HMCTS.

With a passion for crafting clean, efficient, and user-friendly web applications, Iâ€™m always eager to stay on top of the latest trends in frontend development. My expertise extends beyond Angular, with experience in **C# .NET** on the backend. My **BSc [Hons] in Internet Computing** from the University of South Wales has also provided me with a strong foundation in web technologies.

Outside of work, I enjoy sharing my insights and learning with the developer community, which is why Iâ€™ve created this site to not only showcase my **CV** but also to share blog posts about **Angular** development and best practices.

Based in **Aberdare, Wales**, Iâ€™m proud of my Welsh heritage and enjoy practicing my **Welsh** language skills whenever I can.

Thanks for visiting, and feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to connect! ðŸ¤™
